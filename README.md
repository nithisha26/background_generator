# background_generator

This project represents a simple web page that allows users to generate a background gradient by selecting two colors. The page consists of an HTML structure and some CSS styles, along with JavaScript logic to handle the background generation.

The HTML structure includes a <div> container with a heading and a color picker. Inside the color picker, there are two <input> elements of type "color" to select the colors, and a "Generate" button.
  
The CSS styles define the appearance of the page. 
  
The JavaScript code includes a function named generateBackground(), which is called when the "Generate" button is clicked. It retrieves the selected colors from the color input elements, and then sets the background to a linear gradient using the selected colors.hello.
